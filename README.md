# Web Development Project 2 - *Guess the Song*

Submitted by: **Yaritza Yanez**

This web app: **an Ariana Grande themed flashcard game where players read a lyric-inspired clue or look at a stylized vinyl cover, click the card to reveal the song title, and move to a random new card.**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:


- [x] **The app displays the title of the card set, a short description, and the total number of cards**
  - [x] Title of card set is displayed
  - [x] A short description of the card set is displayed
  - [x] A list of card pairs is created
  - [x] The total number of cards in the set is displayed
  - [x] Card set is represented as a list of card pairs (an array of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the question and answer is perfectly fine)
- [x] **A single card at a time is displayed**
  - [x] Only one half of the information pair is displayed at a time
- [x] **Clicking on the card flips the card over, showing the corresponding component of the information pair**
  - [x] Clicking on a card flips it over, showing the back with corresponding information
  - [x] Clicking on a flipped card again flips it back, showing the front
- [x] **Clicking on the next button displays a random new card**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Cards contain images in addition to or in place of text
  - [x] Some or all cards have images in place of or in addition to text
- [x] Cards have different visual styles such as color based on their category
  - Example categories you can use:
    - Difficulty: Easy/medium/hard
    - Subject: Biology/Chemistry/Physics/Earth science

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Added 15 Ariana Grande song cards with difficulty labels.

## Notes

The main challenge was making sure the next card appears in random order instead of moving sequentially. The app also uses lyric-inspired clue summaries instead of copying full song lyrics.
